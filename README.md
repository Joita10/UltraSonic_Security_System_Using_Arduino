# UltraSonic_Security_System_Using_Arduino
Its an Ultrasonic based security alarm, it utilizes the concept of SONAR where it emits a sound signal which travels through the air, if there is an object or obstacle on its path, the emitted sound signal bounces back to the module, the time taken by the ultrasound is measured, the speed of sound is known, the distance is easily calculated.
